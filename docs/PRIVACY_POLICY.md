# PayGuard Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 7, 2026  
**Version:** 2.0.0

## Introduction

PayGuard is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our scam detection and fraud prevention services.

**Key Principle: PayGuard operates with a privacy-first, consent-driven architecture.** We collect no data without your explicit consent, and all sensitive data stays on your device unless you choose otherwise.

## What We Don't Do

PayGuard **DOES NOT**:

- ❌ Continuously capture your screen
- ❌ Monitor your clipboard in the background
- ❌ Collect browsing history
- ❌ Track your location
- ❌ Store personal information without consent
- ❌ Sell or share your data with third parties
- ❌ Use data for advertising

## Data Collection

### No Collection Without Consent

PayGuard collects **no data by default**. All data collection features are:
1. **Opt-in only** - You must explicitly enable them
2. **Clearly explained** - We tell you exactly what we collect and why
3. **Revocable** - You can disable collection at any time

### User-Initiated Scans

When you explicitly request a scan (by clicking "Scan Now"), we:
- Temporarily capture your screen for analysis
- Process the image **locally on your device**
- Delete the image immediately after analysis
- Never transmit raw screenshots

### URL Checking

When enabled, PayGuard checks URLs against our threat database:
- Only the URL is sent (not page content)
- No browsing history is stored
- Checks are not linked to your identity

### Telemetry (Opt-in Only)

If you **choose** to enable telemetry to help improve PayGuard:
- All data is **fully anonymized** before transmission
- No personal identifiers are included
- You can opt out at any time
- We use aggregated data only to improve detection

## Data Storage

### On Your Device

All sensitive data is:
- **Encrypted** using AES-256-GCM
- **Stored locally** on your device only
- **Automatically deleted** after analysis (ephemeral storage)
- **Never written unencrypted** to disk

### What We Store on Servers

If you enable telemetry, we store:
- Anonymized detection statistics
- Aggregated feedback (no personal data)
- Performance metrics

We **never** store:
- Raw screenshots
- Clipboard contents  
- Personal information
- IP addresses
- Browsing history

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

1. **Access** - View what data we have about you
2. **Delete** - Request deletion of any stored data
3. **Opt Out** - Disable all data collection at any time
4. **Export** - Download your data in standard formats
5. **Transparency** - View our audit logs of data operations

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for all stored data
- **TLS 1.3** for all network communications
- **Secure key storage** using platform-specific APIs
- **Audit logging** of all data operations
- **Tamper-evident logs** with chain hashing

## Third-Party Services

- OpenPhish
- PhishTank
- URLhaus

These services only receive URLs (not personal data) when URL checking is enabled.

## Children's Privacy
